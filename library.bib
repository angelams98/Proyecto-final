abstract = {Post-harvest processing of cocoa beans, such as fermentation, not only determines the formation of aroma and flavor compounds, but also contributes to the formation of bioactive compounds with health benefits. Nevertheless, most studies associate these beneficial effects to the polyphenols present and little is known about the potential health effects of other cocoa components such as bioactive peptides. Thus, in the present review we focus on the role of cocoa bean protein hydrolysis for the release of bioactive peptides. Also, the potential health benefits of cocoa bean hydrolysates and peptides, specifically, antioxidant, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anti-Alzheimer, antiobesogenic and antitumor activities are presented. However, more research is needed that considers bioaccesibility and bioavailability studies, as well as in vivo studies and clinical trials, for testing cocoa bean bioactive peptides. This knowledge may allow the development of nutraceuticals and food products with specific biological activities as well as good aroma and flavor.},

abstract = {Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is very common metabolic disorder affecting people of all age groups. The change in life style and environmental factors are the considerable factors which are involved in the development of the disorder. The different parts of medicinal plants vary in their composition of bioactive compounds. There are reports on antidiabetic activity of C. auriculata L. flower and leaves. Traditionally bud of C. auriculata L. is used to treat diabetes rather than flower. This study aims to explore the antidiabetic efficiency of bud and flower and to identify the differential composition of phycompounds present in bud and flower parts of C. auriculata L. The compounds present in the bud and flower parts were identified using LC-ESI/MS analysis. Antidiabetic activity of C. auriculata L. bud and flower parts was studied in high fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. During which parameters such as feed intake, water intake, and body weight were monitored. After 21 days of the study, blood parameters like insulin, glucose, lipid profile, hepatic function test, renal function test and oxidative stress markers were analysed. Real time PCR was done to monitor the expression of IRS2 and GRIA2 genes. The LC-ESI/MS analysis showed the presence of various phenolics and flavonoid compounds specific to bud and flower parts. The antidiabetic activity results showed that the animal treated with C. auriculata L. bud ethanol extract (CABE500) could better reverse and control the progression of the disease compared to the flower ethanol extract. The gene expression studies revealed that regulation of IRS2 gene occurred in bud but not in flower extract treated animal livers and no differential expression of GRIA2 gene in all the experimental groups. C. auriculata L. bud extract can potentially better control the diabetes compared to the flower extract.},

abstract = {Purpose: To clarify the diabetes-reducing abilities of the polyphenol-rich extract from Tadehagi triquetrum (HC) in diabetic ob/ob mice. Methods: Aerial parts of T. triquetrum were extracted under reflux and partitioned by n-butanol to generate HC. The effects of HC consumption on blood glucose and lipids, insulin resistance, and liver glucose metabolism were evaluated in vivo. The main compounds of HC were tested for their effects on stimulating glucose consumption and uptake by HepG2 hepatocytes and C2C12 myotubes. Results: After HC treatment, body fat, subcutaneous fat, and epidydimal fat masses decreased (p {\textless} 0.05), while mean daily food intake was unaffected. HC (200–400 mg/kg) decreased fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein (GSP), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc); it also lowered hyperinsulinemia, improved oral glucose tolerance, and reduced hyperlipidemia and liver fat content (p {\textless} 0.05). HC treatment markedly elevated liver glycogen content and activity of hepatic glucokinase and pyruvate kinase (p {\textless} 0.05). Eight polyphenols were isolated from HC, six of which potently stimulated glucose consumption and uptake in vivo. Conclusion: HC has potent antidiabetic activities. Polyphenols are the main compounds accounting for these effects. Chronic oral administration of HC may be an alternative therapy for managing diabetes, but this has to be subjected first to clinical studies.},

abstract = {Apples are a major source of flavonoids in the Western diet, and flavonoid-rich foods may help protect against chronic diseases by antioxidant mechanisms. In the present study we investigated: (1) the antioxidant capacity of representative apple polyphenols and their contribution to the total antioxidant capacity of apple extracts; (2) the effects of adding apple extract to human plasma in vitro on oxidation of endogenous antioxidants and lipids; and (3) the effects of apple consumption by humans on ex vivo oxidation of plasma antioxidants and lipids. We found that the apple-contained flavonols and flavanols, quercetin, rutin, (-)-epicatechin, and (+)-catechin, had a higher antioxidant capacity than the dihydrochalcones, phloridzin and phloretin, and the hydroxycinnamate, chlorogenic acid. However, together these apple polyphenols contributed less than 20{\%} to the total antioxidant capacity of aqueous apple extracts. When human plasma was exposed to a constant flux of aqueous peroxyl radicals, endogenous ascorbate (70.0 ± 10.3 $\mu$M) was oxidized within 45 min of incubation, while endogenous urate (375 ± 40 $\mu$M) and $\alpha$-tocopherol (24.7 ± 1.2 $\mu$M) were oxidized after ascorbate. Addition of 7.1 or 14.3 $\mu$g/ml total phenols of apple extract did not protect ascorbate from oxidation, but increased the half-life (t 1/2) of urate from 136 ± 15 to 192 ± 16 and 208 ± 23 min, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05 each), and t1/2 of $\alpha$-tocopherol from 141 ± 18 to 164 ± 8 min (p = ns) and 188 ± 8 min (p {\textless} 0.05). Lipid peroxidation started after ascorbate depletion, and addition of apple extract increased the lag time preceding detectable lipid peroxidation from 36.3 ± 3.7 to 50.9 ± 2.7 min (p {\textless} 0.05) and 70.4 ± 4.2 min (p {\textless} 0.001). However, when six healthy volunteers ate five apples and plasma was obtained up to 4 h after apple consumption, no significant increases in the resistance to oxidation of endogenous urate, $\alpha$-tocopherol, and lipids were found. Thus, despite the high antioxidant capacity of individual apple polyphenols and apple extracts and the significant antioxidant effects of apple extract added to human plasma in vitro, ingestion of large amounts of apples by humans does not appear to result in equivalent in vivo antioxidant effects of apple polyphenols. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective: The effects of certain tea components on the prevention of obesity in humans have recently been reported, although it is still unclear whether black tea consumption is beneficial. We obtained black tea extract (BTPE) consisting of polyphenols specific to black tea, and from it, prepared a polymerized polyphenol fraction (BTP). The effectiveness of oral administration of the BTPE was examined in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: Effects of BTPE or BTP on pancreatic lipase activity were investigated in vitro. Male Wistar rats were administered an oral lipid emulsion containing BTPE at a concentration of 500 or 1000 mg/kg body weight and sequential plasma lipid levels were measured. Female C57BL/6N mice were fed a standard or high-fat diet supplemented with 1{\%} or 5{\%} (w/w) BTPE for 8 wk and changes in body weight were examined. Results: BTP and BTPE inhibited pancreatic lipase activity with an IC50 of 15.5 and 36.4 $\mu$g/mL in vitro, respectively. BTPE suppressed increases in rat plasma triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent manner after oral administration of a lipid emulsion. Furthermore, administration of the 5{\%} BTPE suppressed increases in body weight (P {\textless} 0.05), parametrial adipose tissue mass, and liver lipid content (reduced to 56.9{\%} and 81.7{\%} of control mice, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05) in mice fed a high-fat diet. Conclusion: The BTPE may prevent diet-induced obesity by inhibiting intestinal lipid absorption. It was suggested that the major active component in the BTPE was BTP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: The diversity of the chemical structures of dietary polyphenols makes it difficult to estimate their total content in foods, and also to understand the role of polyphenols in health and the prevention of diseases. Global redox colorimetric assays have commonly been used to estimate the total polyphenol content in foods. However, these assays lack specificity. Contents of individual polyphenols have been determined by chromatography. These data, scattered in several hundred publications, have been compiled in the Phenol-Explorer database. The aim of this paper is to identify the 100 richest dietary sources of polyphenols using this database. Subjects/Methods: Advanced queries in the Phenol-Explorer database (www.phenol-explorer.eu) allowed retrieval of information on the content of 502 polyphenol glycosides, esters and aglycones in 452 foods. Total polyphenol content was calculated as the sum of the contents of all individual polyphenols. These content values were compared with the content of antioxidants estimated using the Folin assay method in the same foods. These values were also extracted from the same database. Amounts per serving were calculated using common serving sizes. Results: A list of the 100 richest dietary sources of polyphenols was produced, with contents varying from 15 000 mg per 100 g in cloves to 10 mg per 100 ml in ros{\'{e}} wine. The richest sources were various spices and dried herbs, cocoa products, some darkly coloured berries, some seeds (flaxseed) and nuts (chestnut, hazelnut) and some vegetables, including olive and globe artichoke heads. A list of the 89 foods and beverages providing more than 1 mg of total polyphenols per serving was established. A comparison of total polyphenol contents with antioxidant contents, as determined by the Folin assay, also showed that Folin values systematically exceed the total polyphenol content values. Conclusions: The comprehensive Phenol-Explorer data were used for the first time to identify the richest dietary sources of polyphenols and the foods contributing most significantly to polyphenol intake as inferred from their content per serving.},

Red rice is distinguishable due to its great nutritional value compared to the regular white variety. Its red pericarp pigmentation is due to the bioactive compounds that are responsible for its health benefits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical-chemical characterization, antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive capacity of flours of three different red rice cultures (Rubi, Virg{\'{i}}nia and Pequeno). All samples presented specific levels of carbohydrates for cereals with low fat content and excellent levels of protein and resistant starch. In addition, the samples had a high antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive capacity. Antihyperglycemic capacities were measured as percent inhibition for amylase (56.7-76.5{\%}) and glycosidase (81.0-76.6{\%}), respectively, and antihypertensive capacity as the percentage inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (38.4-34.7{\%}). In addition, Pequeno flour presented the best results for antioxidant and antihyperglycemic capacity in comparison to the two flours tested. Thus, all red rice flours can be a source of functional compounds when added to food.},

abstract = {Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) is a healthy and nutritious food with a unique bitter flavor and is broadly exploited in traditional medicine. Recently, preclinical studies have demonstrated that bitter gourd has potential efficacy to alter type II diabetes and inflammation, imparts radioprotection and hepatoprotection, affect immunomodulation related to metabolic abnormalities, and exerts therapeutic efficacy to combat against various malignancies. Recent research has focused on phytochemical constituents of bitter gourd that alter the metabolic abnormalities and cell signaling cascade of malignancies and metabolic disorders. Several mechanistic studies have shown that bitter gourd wields hypoglycemic potential in various ways such as inhibition of intestinal glucose uptake, downregulation of gluconeogenic enzymes, stimulation of glucose utilization in peripheral skeletal muscle, and insulin secretory function. The anticancer activities have been reported through the induction of apoptosis on cancer cells, the arrest of cell cycle, and inhibition of cancer stem cells, with the precise mechanisms of these effects yet to be mapped out. Importantly, bioactive components of bitter gourd are effective in targeting risk factors associated with metabolic disorders, at specific molecular sites and the related cell signaling cascade that may possibly pave the way toward fruitful metabolic disorder and tumor prevention. In this chapter, we focus on illustrating the efficacy of the various bioactive compounds of bitter gourd on metabolic disorders and tumor progression. We further elucidate the targeted molecular mechanistic actions of the inherent natural compounds of bitter gourd on metabolic enzymes and drug transporters causing metabolic alterations and induction of cell death pathways. This review highlights the efficiency of the multiple bioactivities of bitter gourd that include metabolic alteration and modulation of molecular and cellular targets. Since an all-inclusive review on the bitter gourd and its valuable attributes is lacking, our comprehensive review endeavors to accomplish and pave the way to gain a thorough understanding to develop modalities for personalized medicine and natural tools for the treatment of metabolic disorders and tumor prevention.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of naringin, a major flavonoid in grapefruit and citrus fruits, on the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) projection in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo and the potential underlying mechanisms focusing on the induction of glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), well known as an important neurotrophic factor involved in the survival of adult DA neurons. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) was unilaterally injected into the medial forebrain bundle of rat brains for a neurotoxin model of PD in the presence or absence of naringin by daily intraperitoneal injection. To ascertain whether naringin-induced GDNF contributes to neuroprotection, we further investigated the effects of intranigral injection of neutralizing antibodies against GDNF in the MPP+ rat model of PD. Our observations demonstrate that naringin could increase the level of GDNF in DA neurons, contributing to neuroprotection in the MPP+ rat model of PD, with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Moreover, naringin could attenuate the level of tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ in microglia increased by MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra. These results indicate that naringin could impart to DA neurons the important ability to produce GDNF as a therapeutic agent against PD with anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that naringin is a beneficial natural product for the prevention of DA degeneration in the adult brain. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Benzophenone glycosides are a major type of polyphenols present in guava. To date, there is still poor understanding of the relationship between benzophenone glycosides and the hepatoprotective effects attributed to this edible fruit. Herein, the protective effects of guavinoside B (GUB), a main benzophenone glycoside present in guava fruit, against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence measurement demonstrated that GUB (at a concentration of 30 µM) significantly reduced the intracellular ROS levels in APAP-treated HepG2 cells. In addition, GUB (100 mg kg-1 d-1) pretreatment markedly alleviated APAP-induced hepatocyte infiltration and necrosis in C57BL/6 mice, and improved serum and hepatic biochemical parameters, such as ALT, AST, SOD, GSH, ROS, MDA, and TNF-a levels. RT-PCR and western blot experiments revealed that GUB up-regulated Nrf2, GCLC and NQO1, while reducing p-JNK gene expression in the liver. The fermentation experiment further revealed that the displayed beneficial effects of GUB in vivo might be related to the gut microbial metabolite gallic acid. These promising data suggested that GUB showed potent hepatoprotective effects through regulating the Nrf2 and JNK signaling pathways. Further investigation of the absorption and metabolism of benzophenones would be warranted to promote the utilization of these phenolics as functional food ingredients against oxidative stress-induced chronic diseases.},

abstract = {The chemical composition, antioxidant activity (AA), cytotoxic activity, antihemolytic effects, and enzyme inhibition (EI) of lyophilized jabuticaba (Myrciaria jaboticaba) seed extract (LJE) was studied. The main compounds found were castalagin, vescalagin, procyanidin A2, and ellagic acid. LJE was more toxic to cancer cells than to normal cells, meaning relative toxicological safety. This cytotoxic effect can be attributed to the pro-oxidant effect observed in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation assay. LJE inhibited $\alpha$-amylase, $\alpha$-glucosidase, and ACE-I activities and protected human erythrocytes from hemolysis. LJE was incorporated into yogurts at different concentrations and the total phenolic content, AA, and EI increased in a dose-dependent manner. LJE-containing yogurt presented 86{\%} sensory acceptance. The yogurt was administered to Wistar rats bearing cancer and it modulated the gut bacterial microbiota, having a prebiotic effect. LJE is a potential functional ingredient for food companies looking for TPC, AA, and prebiotic effect in vivo.},

Sabara jaboticaba (Plinia jaboticaba) is an Atlantic Forest native fruit, rich in phenolic compounds, such as ellagitannins proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. We investigated whether phenolic-rich Sabara jaboticaba extracts (PRJE), with low (LT) or high (HT) tannin concentration can protect C57BL/6 mice from obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia induced by high-fat-sucrose diet. Both PRJE, especially the HT extract, prevented the body weight gain while avoiding the white adipose tissues overgrowth. In addition, prevented high fasting blood glucose concentrations and attenuated the hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, the HT extract prevented high total cholesterol levels. Taken together, our findings confirm that phenolic compounds from Sabara jaboticaba have antiobesity properties and that the tannins play a decisive role in these effects.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

This study focused on assessing the potential of these wastes as sources of beneficial and bioactive compounds. The results indicated that the squash skin phenolic extract showed higher values of antioxidant activity and phenolic content compared with the values of phenolic for the seed material (3.20 mg GAE/g, 1.82 mg GAE/g, respectively). Furthermore, both squash seed protein hydrolysate and skin phenolic extract inhibited $\alpha$-amylase activity in a dose-dependent manner (5–20 mg/ml). Hydrolyzed peptides from squash seeds possess antihypertensive ability (which was significantly different from the control group p {\textless}.05).

abstract = {Objective: This study examined level of wine consumption and total mortality among 802 older adults ages 55-65 at baseline, controlling for key sociodemographic, behavioral, and health status factors. Despite a growing consensus that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced total mortality, whether wine consumption provides an additional, unique protective effect is unresolved. Method: Participants were categorized in three subsamples: abstainers, high-wineconsumption moderate drinkers, and low-wine-consumption moderate drinkers. Alcohol consumption, sociodemographic factors, health behavior, and health problems were assessed at baseline; total mortality was indexed across an ensuing 20-year period. Results: After adjusting for all covariates, both high-wine-consumption and low-wine-consumption moderate drinkers showed reduced mortality risks compared with abstainers. Further, compared with moderate drinkers for whom a high proportion of ethanol came from wine, those for whom a low proportion of ethanol came from wine were older, were more likely to be male, reported more health problems, were more likely to be tobacco smokers, scored lower on socioeconomic status, and (statistical trend) reported engaging in less physical activity. Controlling only for overall ethanol consumption, compared with moderate drinkers for whom a high proportion of ethanol came from wine, those for whom a low proportion of ethanol came from wine showed a substantially increased 20-year mortality risk of 85{\%}. However, after controlling for all covariates, the initial mortality difference associated with wine consumption was no longer signifi cant. Conclusions: Among older adults who are moderate drinkers, the apparent unique effects of wine on longevity may be explained by confounding factors correlated with wine consumption.},

abstract = {A practical approach to control glycemia in diabetes is to use plant natural products that delay hydrolysis of complex sugars and promote the diminution of the release of glucosyl units into the blood plasma. Polyphenolics have been described as being effective in inhibiting amylases and $\alpha$-glucosidases. Grape pomace is an important sub product of the wine industry, still rich in many compounds such as polyphenolics. In this context, the purpose of this study was to search for possible effects of a grape pomace extract on salivary and pancreatic $\alpha$-amylases and $\alpha$-glucosidase, as well as on intestinal glucose absorption. The Merlot grape pomace extract (MGPE) was prepared using a hydroalcoholic mixture (40{\%} ethanol + 60{\%} water). In vitro inhibition was quantified using potato starch (for amylases) and maltose (for $\alpha$-glucosidase) as substrates. In vivo inhibition was evaluated by running starch and maltose tolerance tests in rats with or without administration of MGPE. Ranking of the extract compounds for its affinity to the $\alpha$-amylases was accomplished by computer simulations using three different programs. Both $\alpha$-amylases, pancreatic and salivary, were inhibited by the MGPE. No inhibition on $\alpha$-glucosidase, however, was detected. The IC50 values were 90 ± 10 $\mu$g/mL and 143 ± 15 $\mu$g/mL for salivary and pancreatic amylases, respectively. Kinetically this inhibition showed a complex pattern, with multiple binding of the extract constituents to the enzymes. Furthermore, the in silico docking simulations indicated that several phenolic substances, e.g., peonidin-3-O-acetylglucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, besides catechin, were the most likely polyphenols responsible for the $\alpha$-amylase inhibition caused by MGPE. The hyperglycemic burst, an usual phenomenon that follows starch administration, was substantially inhibited by the MGPE. Our results suggest that the MGPE can be adequate for maintaining normal blood levels after food ingestion.},

Thus, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) constitutes the essential remedy for the treatment of AD. The study aims to evaluate the interactions between natural molecules and AChE by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The molecules like alkaloids, polyphenols and substrates of AChE have been considered for the study with a major emphasis on affinity and kinetics. To better understand the activity of small molecules, the investigation is supported by both experimental and theoretical approach such as fluorescence, Circular Dichroism (CD) and molecular docking studies. Amongst the screened ones tannic acid showed promising results compared with others. The methodology followed here have highlighted many molecules with a higher affinity towards AChE and these findings may take lead molecules generated in preclinical studies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we suggest a unique signature for the heterogeneous analyte model using competitive experiments for analyzing simultanous interactions of both the analytes.},

abstract = {Prenatal stress is known to induce emotional and cognitive dysfunction in the offspring of both humans and experimental animals. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a major polyphenol in olive oil with reported ability modulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, was performed to investigate its preventive effect on prenatal stress-induced behavioral and molecular alterations in offspring. Rats were exposed to restraint stress on days 14-20 of pregnancy. HT was given at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg/day. The spontaneous alternation performance and Morris water maze confirmed the impaired learning capacity and memory performance induced by prenatal stress in both male and female offspring, and these effects were markedly restored in the HT supplement groups. Through tissue analysis of the hippocampi of male offspring, we found that the stress-induced downregulation of neural proteins, including BDNF, GAP43, synaptophysin, NMDAR1, NMDANR2A and NMDANR2B, was prevented by HT. Prenatal stress-induced low expression of glucocorticoid receptor was also increased by HT, although basal fetal serum corticosterone levels were not different among the four groups. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in prenatally stressed rats were confirmed with changes in protein oxidation, SOD activity, the expression of mitochondrial complexes and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Meanwhile, HT significantly increased transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3, as well as phase II enzyme-related proteins, including Nrf2 and HO-1, which may contribute to the decreased oxidative stress and increased mitochondrial function shown with HT supplementation. Taken together, these findings suggest that HT is an efficient maternal nutrient protecting neurogenesis and cognitive function in prenatally stressed offspring.},

abstract = {Phenolic compounds contribute to the bioactive properties of olive oil. However, olive oils can only support a health claim concerning the protection against oxidative stress depending on the polyphenolic concentration, requiring effective measures during extraction to preserve/enhance their concentrations. The effect of the malaxation temperature (22, 28 and 34 °C) on the phenolic profile was studied for industrially extracted cv. Cobran{\c{c}}osa oils. Higher malaxation temperatures decreased the contents of the majority of the chromatographically detected compounds (P {\textless} 0.05, one-way ANOVA), enabling oils' differentiation. This decreasing trend was observed for hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol bound forms, determinant for the health claim, which were also negatively affected by temperature, despite revealing that all the industrially extracted oils tested supported the health claim. The observed constant free to bound forms ratio showed that the temperature range tested had a minor effect on bound-forms hydrolysis, being both free and bound forms equally affected by temperature.},

In this study, we tested the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory ability of destarched rice, Prozyme 2000p treated destarched rice (DP), and fermented DP samples. Prozyme 2000p treatment increased the ACE inhibitory ability from 15 ± 5{\%} to 45 ± 3{\%}. Fermentation of the Prozyme 2000p treated samples with Enterococcus faecium EBD1 significantly increased the ACE inhibitory ability to 75 ± 5{\%}, while captopril showed an ACE inhibition of 92 ± 4{\%}. An untargeted metabolomics approach using Ultra-high-performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry revealed the abundance of vitamins, phenolic compounds, antioxidant peptides, DPP IV inhibitory peptides, and antihypertensive peptides in the fermented samples which may account for its strong ACE inhibition. Although fermented DP had decreased fatty acid levels, the amount of essential amino acid improved drastically compared to destarched rice. Our results show that fermenting Prozyme-treated destarched rice with Enterococcus faecium EBD1 generates abundant bioactive compounds necessary for developing antihypertensive functional foods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Progressive accumulation of misfolded amyloid proteins in intracellular and extracellular spaces is one of the principal reasons for synaptic damage and impairment of neuronal communication in several neurodegenerative diseases. Effective treatments for these diseases are still lacking but remain the focus of much active investigation. Despite testing several synthesized compounds, small molecules, and drugs over the past few decades, very few of them can inhibit aggregation of amyloid proteins and lessen their neurotoxic effects. Recently, the natural polyphenol curcumin (Cur) has been shown to be a promising anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent for several neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its pleotropic actions on the central nervous system, including preferential binding to amyloid proteins, Cur is being touted as a promising treatment for age-related brain diseases. Here, we focus on molecular targeting of Cur to reduce amyloid burden, rescue neuronal damage, and restore normal cognitive and sensory motor functions in different animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. We specifically highlight Cur as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases. In addition, we discuss the major issues and limitations of using Cur for treating these diseases, along with ways of circumventing those shortcomings. Finally, we provide specific recommendations for optimal dosing with Cur for treating neurological diseases.},

PRSE effect on cell survival was investigated in other tumor and normal cell lines of both mouse and human origin, demonstrating that PRSE is more active against breast cancer cells. Cytofluorimetric analysis of A17 cells demonstrated that sub-lethal doses of PRSE reduce the number of cells in S phase, inducing the accumulation of cells in G1 phase of cell cycle. In addition, the migration of A17 cells was studied monitoring the ability of PRSE to inhibit cellular mobility. Gene expression analysis revealed the modulation of 12 genes playing different roles in the cellular migration, adhesion and invasion processes. Finally, in vivo experiments showed the growth inhibition of A17 cells orthotopically transplanted into FVB syngeneic mice fed with PRSE. Overall, we demonstrated that PRSE exerts important biological activities against a highly invasive breast cancer cell line both in vitro and in vivo suggesting the strawberry extracts as preventive/curative food strategy.},

The present study was aimed to investigate the usability of wine lees as feed for ruminants in fattening conditions by in vitro and in vivo trials. In in vitro experiments (in vitro I and II), the following four treatments were prepared: 100{\%} dry matter (DM) rolled barley as a control (WL0), and replaced 7.5{\%} DM, 15.0{\%} DM, and 22.5{\%} DM of wine lees as three treatments (WL7.5, WL15, WL22.5, respectively). A linear decrease in gas production was observed at 48 h after incubation with an increase in the percentage of wine lees in the substrate (P {\textless} 0.01). The DM and crude protein (CP) digestibility were linearly decreased with wine lees inclusion (P {\textless} 0.01), while neutral detergent fiber expressed exclusive of residual ash (NDFom) digestibility was linearly increased (P {\textless} 0.05). The polyphenolic contents and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability of fermented residue were linearly increased with wine lees inclusion (P {\textless} 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The proportion of $\alpha$-linolenic acid and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the residues after incubation was linearly increased with wine lees inclusion (P {\textless} 0.01). Additionally, in in vivo experiment, four cannulated wethers were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment and each wether was assigned to one of the following feeding treatments: C, basal concentrate without wine lees; L, 6.7{\%} DM of concentrate was replaced with wine lees; M, 13.3{\%} DM of concentrate was replaced with wine lees; H, 20.0{\%} DM of concentrate was replaced with wine lees. The apparent digestibilities of DM, CP, and NDFom did not differ among the treatments (P {\textgreater} 0.05). As wine lees increased, the proportion of ruminal propionate at 4 h after feeding and plasma malondialdehyde, which is one of the oxidative stress markers, were decreased (P {\textless} 0.05), and inorganic phosphorus concentration in plasma was increased (P {\textless} 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the nitrogen balance between the treatments. Conclusively, the wine lees substituted for the fattening ration up to 20{\%} DM had no adverse effects on apparent digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and nitrogen balance and decreased an oxidative stress marker in plasma in vivo. Although the gas production and DM and CP digestibility were decreased in vitro, wine lees inclusion protected PUFA from ruminal biohydrogenation during ruminal fermentation. Thus, wine lees have a potential to be an important alternative as a partial substitute for antioxidant products.},

Thirty SHR were randomly assigned to three groups: a control untreated SHR group, an SHR group (1 mL/rat/day) of a control olive oil (17.6 mg/kg of phenolic compounds), and an SHR group (1 mL/rat/day) of the enriched EVOO (750 mg/kg of phenolic compounds) for eight weeks. Ten Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were included as healthy controls. Long-term administration of the enriched EVOO decreased systolic blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy, and improved the ex vivo aortic endothelial dysfunction measured in SHR. Moreover, enriched oil supplementation reduced the plasma levels of Angiotensin II and total cholesterol, and the urinary levels of endothelin-1 and oxidative stress biomarkers, while pro-inflammatory cytokines were unaffected.

abstract = {This chapter provides a description of the different natural sources of polyphenols, such as fruit and vegetables, cereals and legumes, coffee, tea, olive oil, cocoa, herbs, and spices. Industrial processing of these raw materials leads to the production of a huge amount of by-products, which are a good source of antioxidants, mainly polyphenols. Recently, the recovery of these high added-value compounds from food processing by-products is an important issue. Therefore particular attention in this chapter is focused on the new trend of food processing by-products and plant waste extracts as a source of polyphenols.},

@article{Erpel2020,
abstract = {Phlorotannins are phenolic characteristic compounds of brown seaweeds that are only constituted by phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). They are chain- and net-like structures of diverse molecular weights and have been widely identified in Ecklonia, Eisenia, and Ishige species. Since the time they were discovered in the ‘70 s, phlorotannins have been suggested as a main factor responsible for the antimicrobial activities attributed to algae extracts. Currently, cumulative in vitro and in vivo research evidence the diverse bioactivities of phlorotannin extracts -such as antidiabetic, anticancer, and antibacterial- pointing out their potential pharmacological and food applications. However, metabolomic studies and clinical trials are scarce, and thus many phlorotannins health-beneficial effects in humans are not yet confirmed. This article reviews recent studies assessing the antidiabetic and anticancer activities of phlorotannins. Particularly, their potential to prevent and control the progression of these non-communicable diseases is discussed, considering in vitro and animal studies, as well as clinical interventions. In contrast to other approaches, we only included investigations with isolated phlorotannins or phlorotannin-rich extracts. Thus, phlorotannin extraction, purification and characterization procedures are briefly addressed. Overall, although considerable research showing the antidiabetic and anticancer potential of phlorotannins is now available, further clinical trials are still necessary to conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of these compounds as adjuvants for diabetes and cancer prevention or treatment.},

@article{Stern1996,
abstract = {Quantitative measurement of phlorotannins (polyphenolics) in brown algae (Phaeophyta) by calorimetric assays can be confounded because: (1) most such assays also react to nonphlorotannin substances (interferences) and (2) the appropriate reference compound for such assays is not always clear, although phloroglucinol is typically used. We developed a new assay in which 2,4- dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMBA) reacts specifically with 1,3-and 1,3,5- substituted phenols (e.g., phlorotannins) to form a colored product. This new assay, as well as eliminating the problem of measuring interferences, is inexpensive, rapid, and can be used with small sample volumes. We recommend it for all assays of phlorotannins from one or a set of closely related species where the structural types of phlorotannins present are likely to be similar among samples. It is also appropriate for broader surveys of phlorotannin levels across many species, but in this case a reference must be chosen with care. We also compared the DMBA assay to existing assays, including the Folin-Denis [both before and after the samples were mixed with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP)] and the Prussian blue assays. PVPP was not 100{\%} efficient (and often much less) at removing phlorotannins from solution, and its effectiveness varied among different phlorotannins. Thus, in contrast to previous studies, measuring phenolic levels in extracts before and after treatment with PVPP will not necessarily result in an interference-free measure of phlorotannins. Based on an analysis of reactive substances in red and green algae (which do not contain phlorotannins) in the Folin-Denis and Prussian blue assays, we estimate that the average level of interferences (nonphlorotannins) in brown algae measured in these two assays is on the order of 0.5{\%} by dry weight.},

In the last decade, there has been much interest in the potential health benefits of dietary plant polyphenols as antioxidant. Epidemiological studies and associated meta-analyses strongly suggest that long term consumption of diets rich in plant polyphenols offer protection against development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present knowledge about the biological effects of plant polyphenols in the context of relevance to human health. {\textcopyright} 2009 Landes Bioscience.},
